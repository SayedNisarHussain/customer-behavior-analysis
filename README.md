Data Analytics Project - Customer behavior



Project Title: Data Analytics Workflow — From Raw Data to Insights
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics pipeline.
It covers everything from loading raw data in Python to creating a fully interactive Power BI dashboard and presenting key insights in a final report and Gamma-powered presentation.
It is designed to showcase practical analytical skills, data cleaning techniques, SQL proficiency, and dashboard/report creation.

📊 Dataset

Source: (Add dataset source or file name here — e.g., CSV, Excel, API)

Description: Briefly describe what the dataset contains (e.g., sales data, customer behavior, operations metrics).

Size: (Number of rows/columns)

Target: Identify the analytical goals (e.g., identify trends, understand distributions, answer business questions).

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Programming & Data Handling

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook)

Databases & Querying

PostgreSQL

MySQL

SQL Server

Visualization & Reporting

Power BI

Gamma (AI-based presentation tool)

Other

Git/GitHub for version control

🔄 Project Steps
1. Data Loading (Python)

Imported dataset using Pandas.

Conducted initial data preview (info, describe, datatypes).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explored distributions, correlations, trends.

Visualized key variables using plots and charts.

Identified outliers, missing patterns, and anomalies.

3. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing data (imputation/removal).

Corrected inconsistent values.

Formatted dates, categories, and numeric fields.

Engineered additional features when needed.

4. SQL Querying

Loaded cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server.

Performed analytical SQL queries, such as:

Aggregations

Joins

Window functions

Filtering and grouping

Validated Python insights with SQL results.

5. Power BI Dashboard Creation

Imported cleaned dataset.

Built interactive dashboards with:

KPIs

Slicers

Trend charts

Category-level breakdowns

Designed visuals to highlight the most important insights.

6. Reporting & Presentation

Compiled a written report summarizing:

Key findings

Business insights

Recommendations

Created a visually appealing Gamma presentation to present the results.

📈 Dashboard

📝 Results & Key Insights

Summarized the main insights discovered in the analysis. Examples:

Identified top-performing segments

Detected major drivers behind performance metrics

Highlighted bottlenecks or opportunities

Quantified improvement areas
